                I'm currently working as a Client Analyst for Bswift, a cutting edge benefits administration company
                that creates user
                friendly enrollment portals and facilitates transfering the data to vendors. In
                this
                role, I support my teams with quality management, system configuration, vendor management and data analysis. I also consult
                with clients on system functions, data flows and administrator training.

                This is just the starting point for a technology career. This portfolio will continue to grow along with
                my skills. Please refer back as I will be updating this with each new project. I will also detail out what specific technology is being used. Please reach out if any apply to
                you!
